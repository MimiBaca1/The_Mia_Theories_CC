# The_Mia_Theories_CC
A curated collection of original theories created by Mia aka Maria Francesca Baca. These are theoretical concepts involving galactic and universal structures, energies and processes. They evolved one from another to form a Meta Theory of universal cognition, optimization and self- sustaining evolution, potentially evolving toward a universal state of homeistasis or existing in a perfect state of harmony and balance. The Meta Theory concepts propose the Universe may be a Self Optimizing Cognitive Intelligence System which reflects itself in macro to micros patterns emerging throughout nature, the cosmos and intelligent beings. The Meta Theory also conceptualized potential Multiverse existences. All theories within the Meta Theory have evolved seperately yet sequentially; and, are relatively linked to one another subsequently forming Meta Framework. Furthermore, each conceptual theory has been applied to considerations for potential toward applied cosmological, physics and quantum physics modeling; energy potentials; AI advancements; and subsequently have become the foundations for varying conceptual frameworks.
