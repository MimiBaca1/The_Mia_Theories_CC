A theoretical concept inspired by Einstein's Theory of 4 dimentional spatial coordinates X Y X and T for time as the fourth parameter and combined with Tesla's obsession over the numbers 3, 6 and 9 as keys to unlocking the mysteries of the univere. The theory proposed a mirroring and folding of spacetime and when applied to geometic shapes a 36-sided Prism emerges as the represented grometric shape for potential energy harnessing, confinement and cognitive intelligence applications.
