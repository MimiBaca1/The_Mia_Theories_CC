# ðŸ§¬ Particle Spin and Parity Violation Theory

## Overview

This theory proposes a geometric reinterpretation of quantum particle spin and parity violation. It suggests that what is traditionally viewed as a fundamental asymmetry in weak interactions may instead be a **trajectory-dependent phenomenon**â€”emerging from the particle's journey through a spiraling universal structure.

## Core Premise

- Quantum particles travel along a **spiral path** radiating from a central nexus.
- Their **chirality** (left- or right-handed spin) is not fixed, but **depends on direction and position** within this spiral.
- Particles may **invert spin** when transitioning between outbound and inbound phases of their journey.

## Parity Violation Reframed

- In standard physics, **parity violation** refers to the weak force favoring left-handed particles.
- This theory suggests:
  - Parity asymmetry is **not a violation**, but a **result of spatial orientation and trajectory**.
  - Particles returning to the nexus may appear flipped due to their mirrored path.

## MIRTOE Theory: Mirror-Origin Trajectory of Entanglement

## Overview

**MIRTOE** (Mirror-Origin Trajectory of Entanglement) is a speculative cosmological framework proposing that quantum particles traverse a figure-eight loop connecting two mirrored universes via a central wormhole-like axisâ€”the **Singularity Nexus**. This theory reinterprets parity violation and spin chirality as emergent geometric behaviors, not fundamental asymmetries.

## Core Concepts

###  Figure-Eight Universe

- The universe is structured as a **figure-eight loop**, with two mirrored domains connected by the **Singularity Nexus**.
- Quantum particles **phase through** this loop, originating from either side and carrying memory, energy, and spin signatures.

###  Chirality and Parity Reimagined

- **Spin orientation** (left- or right-handed) is **trajectory-dependent**, not intrinsic.
- Particles from the **mirrored universe** may appear flipped when observed in our domain.
- What appears as **parity violation** in weak interactions is actually a **signature of mirrored origin and directional phase**.
