Original Theory Summary
The Singularity Nexus is the central axis of a universal figure-eight cycle, potentially connecting multiple universes. We currently exist on one side of this loop; the other side is where we once existed—and where we will return during the next cosmic expanse.

The universal structure resembles a 3D sunflower, with spiraling arms radiating from the singularity. During each expanse phase, quantum particles emerge from the nexus in a Fibonacci sequence, spiraling outward. These particles act as recorders and memory holders, constantly fluctuating within the field of all possibility, capturing events as they unfold.

As they journey through the spiral:

Their left- or right-handed spin depends on their position and direction of travel.

What appears as parity violation in weak interactions may actually be a trajectory-dependent condition:

Particles leaving the nexus exhibit one chirality.

Particles returning to the nexus may invert spin, carrying accumulated memory and energy density.

This theory reframes chirality and parity asymmetry as emergent geometric behaviors, not fundamental violations—offering a new lens on quantum behavior, cosmological cycles, and the architecture of universal intelligence.
