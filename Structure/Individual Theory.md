# [Theory Name]

## Abstract / Overview
A concise summary of the theory’s core idea, scope, and philosophical foundation.

## Full Conceptual Thesis
Detailed exposition of the theory in its raw form. Include symbolic logic, diagrams, or metaphysical framing as needed.

## Paradigm Challenges
- Existing scientific or philosophical models this theory questions
- Implications for current understanding of universal structure, cognition, or emergence

## Alignments
- Scientific principles, mathematical structures, or discoveries that resonate with the theory
- Conceptual overlaps with known models in physics, cosmology, AI, or energy systems

## Cross-Domain Bridges
